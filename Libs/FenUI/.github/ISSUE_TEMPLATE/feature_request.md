## Summary

A brief description of the feature you'd like.

## Problem / Use Case

What problem does this solve? Why would this be useful?

## Proposed Solution

How do you envision this working?

### API Example

```lua
-- How would developers use this feature?
local widget = FenUI:CreateNewWidget(parent, {
    -- proposed config
})
```

## Alternatives Considered

Have you considered other approaches? Why is this the best option?

## Scope Check

FenUI is a Blizzard-first UI widget library. Does this feature fit that scope?

- [ ] Uses native Blizzard frame templates or APIs
- [ ] Provides graceful degradation when FenUI is missing
- [ ] Follows the design token system
- [ ] Is a reusable component (not addon-specific)

## Additional Context

Mockups, examples from other addons/frameworks, or any other relevant information.
