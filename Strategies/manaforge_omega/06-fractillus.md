# Fractillus - Boss Guide

**Sixth Boss of Manaforge Omega**

## Phase 1 - Wall Management

### Room Layout
- 📏 **6 lanes** divide the room
- 🛡️ **Designate 1 safe lane** - NEVER place walls there
- ⚠️ **5 wall maximum** per lane (6th wall = Crystalline Overcharge wipe)

### Fight Rhythm
**Repeating Cycle:**
1. Create 2 sets of walls
2. Destroy 1 set of walls
3. ⏰ **Eventually run out of space** (soft enrage)

## Creating Walls

**Crystalline Shockwave**
- 🎯 **Targets:** Random players
- 🧱 **Places wall** in your current lane
- 💚 **Heavy DoT applied** after wall spawns
- 🚑 **Healers:** Ready for spot healing
- ❌ **Don't stack multiple walls** in same lane (DoT stacks)

**Shockwave Slam** (Tank Mechanic)
- 🎯 **Targets:** Active tank
- 🧱 **Spawns wall** in tank's lane
- 🔄 **Functions as tank swap**
- 🏹 **Visual indicator:** Small arrow at boss base shows wall spawn location

## Destroying Walls

**Shattershell**
- 🎯 **Targets:** Selected players
- 🧱 **Move to lane** that needs walls destroyed
- 👥 **Multiple people** = destroy multiple walls
- ⚠️ **Don't waste breaks** - avoid too many people in one lane
- 💥 **Nexus Shrapnel zones** spawn after destruction - avoid these

### Strategic Considerations
- 🎯 **Prioritize lanes** with 4-5 walls (prevent reaching 6-wall wipe)
- 📍 **Lane coordination** essential for success
- ⏰ **Manage space efficiently** to extend fight duration

## Heroic Changes

**Void-Infused Nexus Walls**
- 🟣 **New wall type** with enhanced destruction effect
- 💀 **Null Consumption:** Applied to several players when destroyed
- ⭕ **Large ring indicator** around affected players
- 🏃 **Spread quickly** to avoid overlapping damage zones
