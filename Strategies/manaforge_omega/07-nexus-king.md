# Nexus-King Salhadaar - Boss Guide

**Final Boss of Manaforge Omega**

## Phase 1 - Decree Management

### Decree: Oath-Bound
- 📊 **Starting stacks:** 3 on every player
- 🧠 **Failure condition:** Any remaining stacks = mind control
- ✅ **Stack removal:** Get hit by Conquer (group soak on tank)
- 🏃 **Early phase:** Can skip mind control by reaching 50% HP quickly

### Tank Combo System
**Abilities:** Conquer (group soak) | Vanquish (tank solo)
- 🔄 **Rule:** Take one of each ability, swap during each cast
- 🚫 **No alternating patterns** - boss can't do ABABAB sequences

**4 Possible Patterns:**
1. Conquer → Vanquish → Vanquish → Conquer
2. Conquer → Conquer → Vanquish → Vanquish  
3. Vanquish → Vanquish → Conquer → Conquer
4. Vanquish → Conquer → Conquer → Vanquish

### Phase 1 Hazards
- ⚡ **Besiege:** Projectiles fire across room edge-to-edge
- 🏃 **Behead:** Players run away, leave ground scar, get pulled back
- 🐉 **Fractal Claw:** Dragons swipe at players near room edges
- 💥 **Banishment:** Raid damage when debuff expires
- 💚 **Tyranny:** Constant ticking raid damage

## Phase 2 - Dragon Mount (After 3 Combos OR 50% HP)

### Phase Start
- 🌊 **Knockback** from room center - avoid falling off edge
- 🐉 **Boss mounts Dragon** - prioritize Dragon damage
- 🎯 **Cleave if possible** with minimal DPS loss

### Dimension Breath
- 🎯 **Tank targeted** with high magic damage
- 📍 **Face away from raid**
- ⚠️ **Heroic:** Raid damage based on tank's damage taken (use absorbs/mitigation)

### Netherbreaker
- 🎯 **Up to 4 players** get large rings
- 📍 **Group positioning:** All affected run to same platform edge
- 🌀 **Portal spawn:** Locations copy Dimension Breath beams
- 🧠 **Strategy:** Grouping makes dodging much easier

### Phase Duration
- **1st time:** Brief (few mechanics)
- **2nd time:** Much longer duration

## Intermission 1 (~45s after Phase 2 start)

### Split Strategy
- 👥 **2 teams** to separate platforms
- 🔘 **Extra action button** to reach platforms
- 🎯 **Kill adds** then return to main platform

### Platform Adds
**Manaforged Titan** (1 per platform)
- 🏃 **Avoid:** Dread Mortars
- 💥 **Kill before:** Self-Destruct at 100 Energy

**Nexus Prince** (1 per platform)  
- ❗ **INTERRUPT:** Netherblast casts
- 🌪️ **Avoid:** Nexus Beams (rotating)

**Shadowguard Reapers** (Multiple per platform)
- 🎯 **Cleave down** as priority
- 🦘 **Jump to players** and apply Reap
- 🧊 **Stay in melee and CC**

## Intermission 2 (End of Phase 2)

### Boss Transition
- 🐉 **Boss dismounts** Dragon
- 🛡️ **Royal Ward:** Boss takes 99% less damage (DoT classes can still build resources)

### King's Hunger Channel
- 🐉 **Dragon takes 100% increased damage** during channel
- ⚠️ **If channel completes:** Dragon's remaining HP transfers to boss
- 🏃 **Avoid:** Behead lines from Dragon
- 🚑 **Heavy raid damage** throughout intermission

## Phase 3 - Dark Star Management

### Ability Sequence
1. **Galactic Smash** (tank + up to 5 players)
2. **Starkiller Swing** (tank + up to 2 players) × 2
3. Repeat cycle (4th sequence = enrage)

### Dark Star Mechanics
**Galactic Smash spawns Dark Stars:**
- 🌌 **Rift phase:** Pulls players briefly
- 💥 **Spike rings:** Expand outward from star
- 🎯 **Destruction:** Use Starkiller Swing hits to destroy them

### Tank Strategy
- 🔄 **Swap after each hit** (Galactic Smash OR Starkiller Swing)
- 💚 **Twilight Scar DoT** applied to all hit players

## Heroic Changes

**Phase 1**
- 💀 **Death = King's Thrall** (mind control, ignores cheat death)

**Phase 2** 
- 🔥 **Dimension Breath damage** spreads to raid based on tank damage taken
- 🛡️ **Absorbs prevent** raid damage spread
- 🛡️ **Mitigation reduces** raid damage spread

**Phase 3**
- 🌌 **Dark Stars rotate** around platform
- 💥 **Spike rings also rotate** with the stars
